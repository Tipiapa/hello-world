# hello-world
The first repository. I'll also add cheat sheets and other stuff here for future reference.

what is a "commit"
In GitHub, a commit is a snapshot of changes made to a repository's files. It represents a specific version of the codebase at a given point in time. Commits contain the changes that were made, along with a commit message that explains what those changes are. This allows collaborators to track the development progress, review changes, and revert to previous versions if needed. Commits play a crucial role in maintaining a history of code changes and enabling collaboration among developers.

what is a "pull request"
A "pull request" (often abbreviated as "PR") is a feature in platforms like GitHub that allows developers to propose changes they've made in their own branches of a repository to be merged into the main branch. It serves as a way to notify others about your changes, discuss them, and collaborate before incorporating the changes into the main codebase. Pull requests typically include the changes made, related discussions, and can be reviewed by other developers to ensure code quality and correctness before merging.

when shall we branch
Branching is commonly used in version control systems like Git to isolate changes, work on new features, or fix bugs without affecting the main codebase. You might consider creating a new branch when:
	1.	Working on New Features: If you’re adding a new feature to your project, it’s a good idea to create a separate branch. This allows you to work on the feature without affecting the stability of the main codebase.
	2.	Bug Fixes: When you’re addressing a bug or an issue in the code, creating a branch dedicated to fixing that specific problem helps keep the main codebase intact while you work on the solution.
	3.	Experimenting: If you’re unsure about an approach or want to experiment with changes, creating a branch allows you to try things out without affecting the main code.
	4.	Collaboration: If multiple developers are working on the same project, branching allows each developer to work independently on their own tasks without interfering with each other’s work.
	5.	Major Changes: When you’re planning to make significant changes that might take time to develop, test, and review, it’s often a good idea to create a separate branch for these changes.
Remember, the key idea behind branching is to keep changes isolated until they’re tested and ready to be merged into the main codebase. It helps maintain code quality, collaboration, and a history of different development paths.
